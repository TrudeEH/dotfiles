Welcome to Trude's dotfiles. Here you will find my personal configurations, tools and scripts.
I highly recommend anyone interested to fork the repository and modify the configurations to your liking.
This repository can be used as a base for your own dotfiles.

## Structure
- `install.sh`
- `scripts/` Scripts directory. You may find some useful snippets here.
- `nix/` Nix configurations for Linux and macOS.
- `nix-shells/` Nix shells for development environments and temporary programs.

## Getting Started

2. Run the install script:
