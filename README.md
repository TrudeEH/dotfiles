Welcome to Trude's dotfiles. Here you will find my personal configurations, tools and scripts.
I highly recommend anyone interested to fork the repository and modify any configurations to your liking.
These repository can be used as a base for your own dotfiles.

The 'main' branch serves as a place for active development, and becomes a new branch once I deem it stable enough. I am actively maitaining these repositories, so if you find a bug, file a PR or open an issue, I will review and work on it.

To install the configuration on the 'main' repository, run:
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrudeEH/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

To configure wifi, use `nmtui`.
