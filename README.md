Welcome to Trude's dotfiles. Here you will find my personal configurations, tools and scripts.
I highly recommend anyone interested to fork the repository and modify any configurations to your liking.
These repository can be used as a base for your own dotfiles.

The 'main' branch is my current configuration, while others serve as an archive of previous setups.

To install my current configuration, run:
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrudeEH/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```
